# Audio-Book

This Is My first Project In Python. I made an audiobook.
It is made up of two programs:-
1. MP3 Player
2. PDFtoMP3

PDFtoMP3 converts the PDF file to MP3 Format
MP3 Player then plays the mp3 file selected by the user.

If Someone could help merge these two programs into one. It Would be of great help
